#### _Home Page for an Amateur Glam Band_

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Web Browser

## Description

I needed to practice divs, classes, creating a sidebar and columns. Plus I wanted to keep practicing with Cascading Style Sheets and adding images with hovertext. I still need a lot of practice...Anyhow, you can hover over the images.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Have a Web Browser Installed
* Click on the .html Web Page

_It's really that simple._

## Known Bugs

* Well, the sidebar is really short, has no links and doesn't run the length of the page. 
* The image columns are sorta higgledy-piggledy at the moment.
* Yet another ugly, amateur site!
