    I'm hoping we can go the route of The Monkees and establish our image then go on and get talented. Or pay other people 
    to be talented for us. So far it's gonna be an 80's Glam Band. Nobody else in this faux band seems to like Prog Rock like I do. 
    Which is probably lucky, because that probably takes skill.

  <p>As for the rest of this site? I will populate it with columns of random band photos. Hypothetically, we could look something like this:</p>

  <div class="tickets">
